# LilyPond files

This repository contains various LilyPond files, primarily editions I've made of public domain choral pieces that don't currently have good editions available.

I originally made these in an earlier version of LilyPond, but have since upgraded to 2.20.0 on Mac, which is the latest version compatible with macOS Big Sur. An issue I've had is that the LilyPond text editor alters the quotes used to change the octaves, so I've been editing the text in Atom before reopening in LilyPond and compiling there.
